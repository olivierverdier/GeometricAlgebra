description: """
This is an update of the original project 
  [GeometricAlgebra](http://www-sop.inria.fr/marelle/GeometricAlgebra/).
The project should now be compatible with Coq 8.17.0.

Simply run `make` to compile the relevant files.

This is the content of the old Readme:

>This archive contains all the material of the formalisation of our Grassman
>Cayley and Clifford formalisation. It has been developped with Coq 8.3
>To compile it, a simple make should be enough
